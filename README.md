## Notes
The serial port is called with the /dev/serial/by-id form. Not sure if this is universal to all victron FTDI serial cables. This value must be changed. This project was started with the [vedirect project](https://github.com/Moki38/vedirect) software by [Moki38](https://github.com/Moki38) and changed to meet the specifics of the MPPT series charge controllers. In particular, I have an MPPT 75/15 that I use this with.
